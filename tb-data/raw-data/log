From start of test beam until October 23 at 11 PM, noise was really high so most data can be ignored. 
After that, Brian improved the grounding and we are able to work with the default VFAT2 parameters at a threshold of 20 for the VFAT2s. We also started using the AMC13 triggers instead of the external triggers. 

The efficiency of the chambers got up to 60-70% while noise remained below 10%. The latency with the AMC13 is of 28. 

The first good latency scans are:

A screenshot is:

The VFAT2 parameters were:
15-10-23-23-46-06_GEM0_LATENCY_SCAN_AFTER_GROUNDING.txt
15-10-23-23-46-34_GEM1_LATENCY_SCAN_AFTER_GROUNDING.txt

We are doing a TDC run at different HVs so no tracking data with this at the moment.
Threshold scans will be done later also.
